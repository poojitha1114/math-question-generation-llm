@question A school cafeteria offers 4 different main dishes, 3 different side dishes, and 2 different desserts. If a student must choose exactly 1 main dish, 1 side dish, and 1 dessert, how many different meal combinations are possible?
@instruction Select the correct number of possible meal combinations.
@difficulty moderate
@Order 1
@option 9
@option 12
@@option 24
@option 36
@explanation To find the total number of meal combinations, we use the multiplication principle. Since the student must choose 1 main dish, 1 side dish, and 1 dessert, we multiply the number of choices for each category: 4 × 3 × 2 = 24 different meal combinations.

**IMAGE SPECIFICATIONS FOR QUESTION 1:**
**Image Type:** Table/Grid Layout
**AI Generation Prompt:** "A clean, organized cafeteria menu board with three columns: Main Dishes, Side Dishes, and Desserts. The Main Dishes column shows 4 items (Pizza, Pasta, Chicken, Fish) with small food icons. The Side Dishes column shows 3 items (Salad, Fries, Vegetables) with small food icons. The Desserts column shows 2 items (Ice Cream, Cake) with small food icons. Use a modern, clean design with clear typography and subtle food illustrations. Include arrows or lines connecting the columns to show the combination concept."

**Manual Drawing Specifications:**
- **Layout:** Three-column table with equal column widths
- **Column Headers:** "Main Dishes" (left), "Side Dishes" (center), "Desserts" (right)
- **Main Dishes Column:** 4 rows with icons and text: Pizza, Pasta, Chicken, Fish
- **Side Dishes Column:** 3 rows with icons and text: Salad, Fries, Vegetables  
- **Desserts Column:** 2 rows with icons and text: Ice Cream, Cake
- **Connectors:** Thin arrows or lines connecting each main dish to each side dish to each dessert
- **Style:** Clean, modern table with rounded corners, subtle borders, and consistent spacing

@question A cylindrical container has a height of 12 centimeters and a radius of 5 centimeters. If the container is filled with water to 80% of its capacity, what is the volume of water in cubic centimeters? (Use π ≈ 3.14)
@instruction Calculate the volume of water in the container and select the closest answer.
@difficulty moderate
@Order 2
@option 600π
@option 480π
@@option 754.8
@option 942.5
@explanation First, calculate the total volume of the cylinder: V = πr²h = π(5²)(12) = π(25)(12) = 300π cubic centimeters. Since the container is 80% full, multiply by 0.8: 300π × 0.8 = 240π. Using π ≈ 3.14: 240 × 3.14 = 753.6 cubic centimeters. The closest answer is 754.8.

**IMAGE SPECIFICATIONS FOR QUESTION 2:**
**Image Type:** Geometric Diagram (Side View)
**AI Generation Prompt:** "A side view of a transparent cylindrical container with water filled to 80% capacity. The cylinder has a height of 12 cm and radius of 5 cm. Show the water level at 9.6 cm from the bottom (80% of 12 cm). Include measurement labels: height = 12 cm, radius = 5 cm, water height = 9.6 cm. Use a clean, technical drawing style with dashed lines for hidden edges, solid lines for visible edges, and blue shading for water. Include a small ruler or scale bar for reference."

**Manual Drawing Specifications:**
- **Shape:** Rectangle (side view of cylinder) with height 12 cm and width 10 cm (diameter)
- **Water Level:** Horizontal line at 9.6 cm from bottom, filled with blue shading
- **Labels:** 
  - "Height = 12 cm" (vertical arrow from bottom to top)
  - "Radius = 5 cm" (horizontal arrow from center line to right edge)
  - "Water Level = 9.6 cm" (horizontal arrow from bottom to water line)
- **Style:** Technical drawing with:
  - Solid lines for visible edges
  - Dashed lines for hidden edges (top and bottom circles)
  - Blue fill for water area
  - Clear, readable font for all measurements
  - Arrow indicators for each measurement
  - Scale: 1 cm = 1 unit on paper (adjust as needed)
