# 📚 Math Question Generation using LLM

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to generate professional, exam-ready math questions based on a given curriculum and reference (base) questions.  

The final deliverable includes:  
- ✏️ Two **new math questions** similar in type and difficulty to the provided base questions.  
- 🧮 Clean **LaTeX equations**.  
- 🖼️ Professionally styled **diagrams** generated from AI image tools using LLM-generated descriptions.  
- 📄 A **Word document** containing both questions in the required `@title … @plusmarks` format.

## 🛠 Workflow  

### 1️⃣ LLM Question Generation  
- Base questions were provided in the recruiter’s document.  
- Prompted **Cursor AI** to:  
  - Generate **two new similar** questions.  
  - Maintain exact **format** from the problem statement.  
  - Preserve LaTeX formatting.  
  - Suggest detailed image descriptions.  

### 2️⃣ Image Creation  
- LLM output included **precise image descriptions**.  
- Used **DALL·E** to generate professional diagrams:  
  - **Question 1:** Academic table showing categories for combinations.  
  - **Question 2:** Technical drawing of a geometric shape with dimensions.  

### 3️⃣ Document Formatting  
- Final **Word document** includes:  
  - Questions in given format.  
  - Images placed alongside each question.  
  - Consistent fonts, spacing, and style.
